This is a more primitive proxy, that is better for game assets, written in rust.

## Production

Always run the **release** binary on the VPS (debug burns ~10–15% CPU for free):

```bash
cd backend/mochi
cargo build --release
# point your process manager at:
#   backend/mochi/target/release/mochi
# with MOCHI_PORT=3005
```

Do not run `target/debug/mochi` in production.

Mochi blocks private/loopback/metadata hosts and common admin ports on upstream fetches.
